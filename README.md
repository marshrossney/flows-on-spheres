Just a scratch pad to investigate flow-based sampling on spheres, using the simple von Mises-Fisher family of distributions as the target.

To do:
- [x] Implement HMC for [discrete flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02428)
- [ ] Implement [exponential map flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02428)
- [ ] Implement [bump layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00351)
- [ ] Implement [continuous flows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10605v2.pdf)
- [ ] Add documentation and references
- [ ] Add installation and usage instructions and example outputs in this README
